# NUJava

This repository, `NUJava`, serves as a collection of Java programming codes developed during my studies at National University. It showcases various concepts and applications learned throughout my coursework, ranging from fundamental programming constructs to more advanced topics like GUI development and object-oriented programming.

## About

`NUJava` is a personal archive of my academic journey in Java programming. Each folder represents a specific activity, assignment, or project, demonstrating my understanding and implementation of different Java concepts. This repository is a testament to the skills and knowledge acquired during my time at National University.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder typically corresponding to a specific activity or set of related concepts. Here's a breakdown of the current structure:

* **`Activity 1_Input_Output Statement`**: Contains code related to basic input and output operations in Java.
* **`Activity 2_Selection Statement and Activity 3`**: Focuses on conditional logic using selection statements (e.g., `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`).
* **`Activity 4 and Activity 5`**: Further exercises and implementations, likely building upon earlier concepts or introducing new ones.
* **`Activity 6_Class`**: Introduces the fundamental concept of classes in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
* **`Activity_GUI-label, TextFields, and Button`**: Demonstrates the creation of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) using Java Swing or AWT, specifically focusing on labels, text fields, and buttons.
* **`Final Project Title`**: Placeholder for the final project, which will likely integrate multiple concepts learned throughout the course.
* **`Midterm Exam-SET B_Class, Object, Con`**: Code related to the midterm examination, covering classes, objects, and constructors.
* **`Quiz_Methods and Constructor`**: Exercises and solutions for quizzes focusing on methods and constructors.
* **`Seatwork_Class and Object`**: Practical exercises and seatwork related to the core concepts of classes and objects.
* **`Seatwork_Inheritance`**: Demonstrates the implementation of inheritance, a key OOP principle.
* **`Seatwork-If statement`**: Additional practice with `if` statements and conditional logic.

## Key Topics Covered

This repository covers a wide range of Java programming topics, including but not limited to:

* Basic Syntax and Structure
* Variables and Data Types
* Input/Output Operations
* Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`)
* Loops (likely covered in later activities, though not explicitly named in folders)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals:
    * Classes and Objects
    * Constructors
    * Methods
    * Inheritance
    * Encapsulation (implied through class design)
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development (basic elements)

## How to Use

To explore the code in this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/NUJava.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/NUJava.git)
    ```
    (Replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username)
2.  **Navigate to a specific activity folder:**
    ```bash
    cd NUJava/Activity_GUI-label,\ TextFields,\ and\ Button/
    ```
3.  **Compile and run Java files:**
    You will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
    ```bash
    javac YourFileName.java
    java YourFileName
    ```
    (Replace `YourFileName.java` with the actual Java file name)
